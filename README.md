libopusfile-ios
===============

libopusfile cocoapod.

Usage
-----
Until I can be bothered putting it in the master repo, you'll need to add my
spec repo to CocoaPods before you can use it.

```bash
$ pod repo add xiph-ios-podspecs https://github.com/tyrone-sudeium/xiph-ios-podspecs.git
```

Add it to your `Podfile`
```ruby
pod 'libopusfile', '~> 0.4'
```
